# We Have Iron Chef at Home
Expand your cooking horizon

## Introduction 

A non-critical project meant for me to create an application that pulls from a set list of ingredients and cooking categories to cook things I wouldn't normally cook. If you can cook and want to spice up the monthly routine, this is for you.



## Tech used

- Ingredient list pulled from [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
- Immature category list, manually set
- python using pandas for xml



## What does this application do?

The application will make an ingredient call and a category call. The ingredient will be pulled from the `spoonacular API` for a secret ingredient. The category will pull from the `immature-category.txt`. After making the calls, we put these values into an array with python and finally print the ingredient with another call to the `Bing Image Search API`.
